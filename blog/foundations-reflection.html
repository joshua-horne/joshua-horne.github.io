                <h3>•	What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>I’ve learnt so much I feel like an entirely new person. If I had to choose just 3?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I love learning – with a growth mindset I find myself excited to tackle new challenges</li>
                  <li>I’m a team player – I’ve discovered the joy that comes with working in a team and am eager to use my new co-operative skills</li>
                  <li>I’m in charge – by creating a learning plan I can captain myself and others to success</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>Values form the basis of who we are and what we bring to a team, utilising these we give agency to our own learning. Empathy allows us to better understand others, in a team context that enables smooth co-operation and conflict management. The other side to this is self-awareness; the ability to understand ourselves. By recognising our own patterns and behaviours we can make efforts to steer ourselves into better programmers and people.</p>
                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>I’m surprised how much I’m learning. I never had the opportunity to study these ideas and now that I have, I feel all the better for it.</p>
                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>The most challenging aspect of the core learning was acknowledging some of my own weaknesses and bias. But after reflecting on these I can now take steps to mitigate and correct these.</p>
                <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>Employability! EDA hears from the tech industry all the time, that the key skills they want are Human Skills - that is people who are skilled at communicating, problem solving, reflecting and thinking creatively. </p>
                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>No, of course not. These exercises play an important part in my journey at EDA. The curriculum has been carefully crafted in collaboration with employers and the latest research in immersive learning. If I am to find success in this industry it is paramount I engage with all parts of the EDA education model.</p>
