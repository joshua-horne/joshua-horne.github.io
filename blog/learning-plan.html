            <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to find work that I find rewarding with an employer that respects and values my time.</p>
            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
            <p>My strengths lie in my existing problem solving skills Iâ€™ve built up over my career. My limitations are my own motivations and self-management.</p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>As stated above in my limitations, it would be good to gain skills in my own time management as well as developing healthier work habits.</p>
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
            <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h4>
            <p>By being clear in my communication and intentions, giving myself and collaborators deadlines with roadmaps and check-ins to hold each other accountable.</p>
            <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h4>
            <p>Advise my facilitator or other members of my team and seek help in the areas that are giving me trouble.</p>
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
            <p>For help related to the foundations course work my first point of contact will be through the various Slack channels (#foundations, #2022_whai etc) to see if other students are able to help, if further help is needed I can reach out to my facilitator or Re-Leased mentor. For help outside the course work I can bring this up with my facilitator or the human skills staff at EDA. I also understand there are a number of support services offered through EDA.</p>
            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
            <p>The facilitation team are there to check in on my learning and offer advice and guidance. They are also there to respond to any queries I may have about the course.</p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things:</h3>
            <p>I will need to drop and pick up my daughter from school most days, between these times however is where I plan to do most of my study. Any further study required for the day will be done after my daughter has been put to bed or on weekends.</p>
