            <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
            <h3>The Hanged Man (XII) is the twelth major arcana and is meant to represent self-sacrifice, a period of acceptance and reflection.</h3>
            <p>During this exercise of self evaluation it is this result from the many personality and aptitude tests that struck a chord with me.</p>
            <p>"It is what it is"</p>
            <p>"It can't be helped"</p>
            <p>"Que sera, sera"</p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember these have been my mantra.</p>
            <p>But now I find myself with an opportunity to break free from this comfortable but unfulfilling life.</p>
            <p>So what will it take to be successful in this new endeavor? How can I utilize my strengths? How can I mitigate my weaknesses?</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimistic - Not easily stressed. Able to undertake tasks without being overwhelmed and can reassure others.</li>
                <li>Adaptive and Rational - Can switch mindsets to fit new situations easily. Stay versatile and flexible.</li>
                <li>Analytic - Identify the root cause of the issue and work through it step by step. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reserved - An introvert through and through. But many hands make light work, remember that.</li>
                <li>Uncommittal - Can't let them down if you don't promise anything right? Make a commitment so you're held accountable, or you'll only let down yourself.</li>
                <li>Easily Bored - Stay focused, don't get distracted. Bring the fun into your learning, create what you want to create.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As I continue down this new journey I need to be aware of these points.</p>
