            <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>

            <p>For this sprint we are looking at the ideas of Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</p>

            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

            <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain is not fixed and is constantly reshaping itself as you go about your daily activities. If you think of your brain like a power grid, every action you take lights up pathways in different areas of the brain. As these pathways are lit up they are strengthened and allow you to access these parts faster in future. Simultaneously unused pathways will be weakened over time.</p>
            <p>Applying this concept, we can re-shape our brain and ourselves how we like by practising behaviours and patterns we want to strengthen. For example, by mindfully engaging in healthy stress relief habits such as exercise or meditation you are more likely to trigger this behaviour in future and weaken other less healthy habits like smoking or stress-eating.</p>
            <p>A key component in Neuroplasticity is just recognising it exists and being mindful of it. To increase your Neuroplasticity, tailor any new ideas you might want to introduce around existing knowledge you already have. Taking advantage of the existing pathways in your brain and altering them to include these new ideas. Practically this involves contextualizing new concepts and consistent revision of the material.</p>
            <p>You can check out a video summary of these ideas

            <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>

            <p>The growth mindset is the mindset that you can always improve, that when met with failure and setbacks you strive to do better next time. Rather than fixating on the result you have take this as an opportunity to learn and reflect, focus on what can be rather than what is.</p>
            <p>Although not a new concept to me further research of the subject highlights it’s importance as I continue down my learning journey. As with chess, which I play a lot of, it is important to reflect and analyse what worked for you and what didn’t. What did you do well? What did you do poorly? And most importantly how will you do better next time?</p>
